- Probably create a shadow collection class that can alter the items in list provided
- Show selections at the top (config)
- Text overflow and truncate or go to next line
- Disable options

Components:
- Avatar
- Badge (this is what the tags will use)
- Window that can be dragged, minimized/maximized
- Text highlighting (for searching)
- Checkbox
- Radiofield

Misc:
- Continue Core UI plugin
-- Add vite CSS plugin and put Core as top file in library mode export (this is so the CSS gets lumped into it)
-- Minify it, so only the dist dir is there, and it's not in a dist dir... it's just at the root level
- Change global NPM_TOKEN in npmrc to use NPM_TOKEN var from PowerShell
- When we use a KeepAlive in the RouterView, it doesn't work properly... it always show the last one, and if we try to use a dynamic include, it gets all messed up because of Teleport
