# Core UI Components

The intent of this code is used as experiments for how to build commonly reused components that are essential to any application.  Frameworks like Vuetify, PrimeVue, etc. don't allow full control over styling and functionality, so I wanted to experiment with rolling my own components.

[This](https://incutonez.github.io/core/#/) is a deployed example showing some of the components that are in this repo.

## Running

The repo is set up using [NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces), so the installation must be done at the repo's root.  This project uses Node v18.x and npm v9.x.

- `cd core`
- `npm ci`
- `npm run ui`
